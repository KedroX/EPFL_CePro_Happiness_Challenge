# CePro Happiness Challenge - Decisions made - Sami's version

## Why both JavaScript and Python ?
For the data manipulation part, I was really more comfortable to do it
with JavaScript.
I wanted to use JavaScript also for the bonus exercise to
generate the charts, but JavaScript and his charts librairies were not really
appropriate.

Where Python, using [matplotlib], made the bonus exercise way easier and
cleaner. That's why I separated my challenge in two languages.
